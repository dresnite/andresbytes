Hi there! My name is Abner and I am a software developer. I currently work for [Hydreon Corporation](https://hydreon.com/), a Minecraft company, where I contribute to the development of the Lifeboat server. In addition to my work at Hydreon Corporation, I also run my own Minecraft server company called [Hysland LLC](https://hysland.com).

PHP is my primary language of choice, but I also have experience with Java and JavaScript. I am passionate about using technology to create meaningful projects and am always looking to improve my skills and learn new things.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the tech industry and experimenting with new technologies. I am also an avid fan of Minecraft and enjoy using my coding skills to bring new experiences to the game.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile! I hope you find my projects and contributions helpful and interesting. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about tech.
