### Hey, nice to see you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm AndrÃ©s Arias, a 23-year-old self-taught developer who loves technology. Currently, I work at [Trustoo](https://trustoo.nl), developing one of the largest service marketplaces in Europe.

In my free time, I like to make things and write about everything that I discover along the way.

I'm also a big fan of open source, here are some of the projects that I've contributed to:

- [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/pocketmine-mp): A server software for Minecraft Bedrock
- [SkyBlock](https://github.com/dresnite/skyblock): SkyBlock for PocketMine-MP
- [NPCDialog](https://github.com/dresnite/npcdialog): PocketMine-MP virion to add dialogs to entities
- [EasyUI](https://github.com/dresnite/easyui): An easy-to-use form library for PocketMine-MP
- [Pigify](https://github.com/pigifyapp/pigify-core): A platform to force yourself to save money

If you're interested in my journey, [follow me on X](https://x.com/dresnite). I (try to) post daily content on technology and indie hacking.
