Hello there! If you're here, it probably means you want to know who I am or what I'm up to, so let's make this quick:

<strong>My name is AndrÃ©s, and I'm a self-taugh developer building in public.</strong>

My last project was [Pigify](https://pigify.io) (an app that forces you to save) and right now I'm building [Sidemarket](https://sidemarket.io) (a feeless freelance marketplace).

If you want to know more about me, you probably should [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dresnite), I post daily updates and useful information for devs.
